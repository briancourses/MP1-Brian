# MP1-Brian

This repo contains Arduino and processing code for an 8-directional tilt switch connected to an Arduino Leonardo as 
well as pictures of the sensor itelf and a schematic. 

1. The MP1-Input Arduino code is needed to read and print input from the Arduino.
2. The MP1_Proc_Final processing code is a very crude drawing program to demonstrate the sensor. Input from the 
   8-directional tilt switch controls a pen drawing a white line on a black background.
3. The pictures MP1-8DTilt.jpg and MP1-BallBearings.jpg show the physical device.
4. The picture MP1-Schematic_bb.jpg shows a schematic of how the sensor attaches to the Arduino.


## Known Problems
The pen is not set to loop around or stop at the edge of the screen.
